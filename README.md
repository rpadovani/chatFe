**DON'T USE ON A SERVER**

DISCLAIMER <br/>
This is a project for my Computer Science course and doesn't take care about security because of the didatics purpouse; it is focused on socket and pthread.<br/>
All comments are in italian, and I shared the code just because it can be useful to other students.

**I don't accept merge requests or new issues, 'cause I don't work on this project after the exam**.

The code is in the public domain.

For any question, write to the [author](http://rpadovani.com/about)
